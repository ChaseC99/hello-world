# hello-world
My first repository to learn how to use GitHub!

A little bit about my programming history (up until this point):

Hello World! My name is Chase Carnaroli and I am from San Diego, California.

I first started coding in 7th grade on Khan Academy after seeing one of those "Learn to Code" campaigns.
Flash forward to my senior year of high school and, for the first time ever, my school offered AP Computer Science!
I absolutely loved the class and I became pretty good at Java. Me and a couple friends even created a pretty good "Plants vs Zombies"-like game.

For my senior project, I developed an iPhone app (didn't publish it yet though) that was a soccer stats tracking app.
It was made for coaches to easily keep track of their player's statistics.
I learned a lot about Xcode and Swift and I plan on making more iOS apps in the future!

Just recently I graduated high school! This fall (2017), I'll be heading off to UC Irvine to study Computer Science.
I'm really stoked to be majoring in CS and I'm excited to learn and create lots of new things!
